        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Custom Properties are also known as CSS variables or Cascading
          Variables. They are user-defined variables that are declared once and
          can be reused in your stylesheet. It is widely supported on nearly all
          browsers with over 95% compatibility rate. It is Used by declaring a
          custom property on the :root pseudo class (globally) or within a css
          class (locally). Some of the common uses of css custom properties are
          mentioned below:
        </p>
        <div class="uses">
          <ul>
            <li>Box shadows</li>
            <li>Gradients</li>
            <li>Color themes (light / dark mode)</li>
            <li>Grids</li>
            <li>Font scaling</li>
            <li>Responsive layout (set responsive themes for text and font size on smaller screens)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <code class="examples"> :root{ -- color:#ffd100; } </code>

        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        <p>
          CSS custom properties allows you to create reusable values for things
          such as colours, font sizes, or spacing. The value is declared by
          using two dashes followed by the property name, which will allow you
          to be able to reference it throughout the CSS document.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a CSS custom property is defined, it can be referenced by using
          var() instead of using a standard property value.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also makes your stylesheet more maintainable and convenient in
          terms of applying consistent design throughout your stylesheet
        </p>
        <p>
          Since a custom property inherits its value from their parent element,
          you can use the @property rule to control its inheritance. This also
          allows you define what kind of value it accepts, its default value,
          and whether it should inherit its value from its parent element.
        </p>

      <section class="purpose">
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          CSS custom properties enable you to limit the amount of code used in
          your stylesheet. Without these, your code can become repetitive.
          Through the use of CSS variables, you can define a variable in one
          place, then refer to it in other areas of your CSS file to guarantee
          more D.R.Y (Donâ€™t repeat yourself) code.
