        Custom Properties are also known as CSS variables or Cascading
        Variables. They are user-defined variables that are declared once and
        can be reused in your stylesheet. It is widely supported on nearly all
        browsers with over 95% compatibility rate. It is Used by declaring a custom property on the :root pseudo class
        (globally) or within a css class (locally). Some of the common uses of css custom properties are mentioned
        below:
      </p>
      <div class="uses">
        <ul>
          <li>Box shadows</li>
          <li>Gradients</li>
          <li>Color themes (light / dark mode)</li>
          <li>Grids</li>
          <li>Font scaling</li>
          <li>Responsive layout (set responsive themes for text and font size on smaller screens)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <code class="examples">

        :root{ 
            -- color:#ffd100;
        }
    </code>
    </section>
    <section class="what-it-do">
      <h2>What does it do?</h2>
      <p>
        CSS custom properties allows you to create reusable values for things
        such as colours, font sizes, or spacing. The value is declared by
        using two dashes followed by the property name, which will allow you
        to be able to reference it throughout the CSS document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a CSS custom property is defined, it can be referenced by using
        var() instead of using a standard property value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since a custom property inherits its value from their parent element,
        you can use the @property rule to control its inheritance. This also
        allows you define what kind of value it accepts, its default value,
        and whether it should inherit its value from its parent element.

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          CSS custom properties enable you to limit the amount of code used in
          your stylesheet. Without these, your code can become repetitive.
          Through the use of CSS variables, you can define a variable in one
          place, then refer to it in other areas of your CSS file to guarantee
          more D.R.Y (Don’t repeat yourself) code.

      <div class="pros-and-cons">
        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Less repetitive code</li>
          <li>Cleaner and more organized</li>
          <li>More manageable</li>
          <li>Dynamic styling</li>
          <li>Can be scoped</li>

        <h3>Cons:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Unable to use them inside media queries</li>
          <li>Not supported on older browsers (like Chrome 4–48)</li>

        CSS custom properties enable you to limit the amount of code used in your stylesheet. Without these, your code
        can become repetitive. Through the use of variables, you can define a variable in one place, then refer to it in
        other areas of your stylesheet to guarantee more D.R.Y. (Don’t Repeat Yourself) code. CSS variables make your
        code more efficient, organized, clean, and maintainable.
      </p>

      <p>
        They allow for dynamic styling, where the style is updated (while a user is still on the site) using JavaScript,
        such as a dark/light mode feature.
      </p>

      <p>
        Custom properties can also be scoped by declaring them in a single element, so they will only apply to that
        specific element and its children.

      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    </section>

    <section class="issues">
      <h2>Common Issues</h2>

      <h3>Not scoping them correctly</h3>
      <p>If you declare a variable in one selector, other selectors won’t be able to access it unless they are
        descendants (nested within it).</p>

      <h4>Solutions:</h4>
      <div class="solutions">
        <ul>
          <li>Check that your variable is properly scoped.</li>
          <li>Declare the variable globally using the <code class="examples">:root</code> pseudo-selector if you want to
            access it throughout
            your CSS file.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>Not adding a fallback value</h3>
      <p>In situations where a value is invalid (e.g., <code class="examples">--bg-color: 16px</code>), or you forget to
        define a variable altogether, a fallback value
        ensures a substitution can be used. If you don’t add a fallback, then the variable would default to its initial
        or inherited value.</p>

      <h4>Solutions:</h4>
      <div class="solutions">
        <ul>
          <li>Add a fallback value to your variables, or multiple fallback values (in case the first one isn’t applied
            for whatever reason).</li>
          <li>Review your code to ensure you are defining variables and using valid values.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>Overusing custom properties</h3>
      <p>While CSS variables offer more flexibility, overusing them can complicate things by creating cluttered code
        that is difficult to manage.</p>

      <h4>Solutions:</h4>
      <div class="solutions">
        <ul>
          <li>Avoid using them for every single thing and minor layout changes.</li>
          <li>Limit usage of variables to values that will be reused multiple times or that are likely to change.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
