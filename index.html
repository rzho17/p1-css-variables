      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Custom Properties are also known as CSS variables or Cascading
        Variables. They are user-defined variables that are declared once and
        can be reused in your stylesheet. It is widely supported on nearly all
        browsers with over 95% compatibility rate. It is Used by declaring a custom property on the :root pseudo class
        (globally) or within a css class (locally). Some of the common uses of css custom properties are mentioned
        below:
      </p>
      <div class="uses">
        <ul>
          <li>Box shadows</li>
          <li>Gradients</li>
          <li>Color themes (light / dark mode)</li>
          <li>Grids</li>
          <li>Font scaling</li>
          <li>Responsive layout (set responsive themes for text and font size on smaller screens)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <code class="examples">

        :root{ 
            -- color:#ffd100;
        }
    </code>

      <h2>What does it do?</h2>
      <p>
        CSS custom properties allows you to create reusable values for things
        such as colours, font sizes, or spacing. The value is declared by
        using two dashes followed by the property name, which will allow you
        to be able to reference it throughout the CSS document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a CSS custom property is defined, it can be referenced by using
        var() instead of using a standard property value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since a custom property inherits its value from their parent element,
        you can use the @property rule to control its inheritance. This also
        allows you define what kind of value it accepts, its default value,
        and whether it should inherit its value from its parent element.
      </p>

      <div class="pros-and-cons">
        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Less repetitive code</li>
          <li>Cleaner and more organized code</li>
          <li>Saves you time</li>
          <li>More manageable</li>
          <li>Dynamic styling</li>
          <li>Can be scoped</li>
          <li>Supported on most modern browsers</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Overusing variables can overcomplicate things</li>
          <li>Not supported on older browsers (like Chrome 4–48)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        CSS custom properties enable you to limit the amount of code used in your stylesheet. Without these, your code
        can become repetitive. Through the use of variables, you can define a variable in one place, then refer to it in
        other areas of your stylesheet to allow for bulk editing and guarantee more D.R.Y (Don’t repeat yourself) code.
        CSS variables make your code more efficient, organized, clean, and maintainable. You can even provide fallback values in the event you don't properly define a value, which ensures the styling is still applied. 
      </p>

      <p>
        They allow for dynamic styling, where the style is updated (without needing to reload the site) using JavaScript, such as implementing a light and dark mode feature.
      </p>

      <p>
        Custom properties can also be scoped locally (by declaring them in a single element, so they will only apply to that specific element and its children) or defined globally (with the <code class="examples">:root</code> selector).
